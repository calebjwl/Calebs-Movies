# Interactive Data Display
​
**Time Frame:** 1 week
​
The goal of the project is to take in a JSON collection of data and display it on an HTML page in a visually appealing and usefully interactive manner.

You will be provided with a basic Express server that will render an HTML page at the root route and a JSON collection of data at the `GET /movies` route.

Your index page should make an HTTP request to acquire the collection of data, display it in an easy-to-parse and visually appealing manner, and provide useful interactions (such as being able to sort and filter by various attributes).

Should you need clarification on any aspect of these instructions, feel free to ask any questions.
​
### Requirements
​
The project must be completed in standard web technologies - HTML, CSS (or SCSS), and JavaScript (or TypeScript).
